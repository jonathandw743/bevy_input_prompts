Some time ago Xelu created awesome pack of button graphics and kindly publicized it under CC0.
Sadly, the vector source was in ".fla" format, which is only openable in abominable Adobe Animate.

Thus, for sake of all the people like me who needed higher resolution than 100x100, I've extracted, arranged and fixed all the vector graphics in SVG format - they can be found in "Vector Source.svg" file.

IMPORTANT NOTICE: While Xelu shared this pack under CC0 license, Steam Deck buttons they created are using COCOGOOSE font, which is free only for *personal use*. If you need Steam Deck buttons for any commercial use, you should change the font in Vector Source (be it SVG or FLA) to any other font that you have rights to (or one that is free for commercial use).

I don't intend to keep this project updated may there be any updates from Xelu, so in case anyone needs to recreate my steps:
- Export SVGs of all frames from aAA (abominable Adobe Animate)
- Create new SVG file in Inkscape
- Import all exported images into Inkscape by drag-and-dropping them into created file
- Search for each separate button category (for example "Keyboard_Dark")
- Group each searched category and use my [Group by z-order extension for Inkscape](https://github.com/haaldor/inkscape_order-by-z-order) created exactly for this project
- Position groups where you want them. Done.
